Funny, but it's true What loneliness can do Since I've been away I have loved you more each day 
Walking back to happiness, woopah oh yeah yeah Said goodbye to loneliness, woopah oh yeah yeah I never knew I'd miss you Now I know what I must do Walking back to happiness I shared with you (Yay, yay, yay, yay ba dum be do) 
Making up for things we said, woopah oh yeah yeah And mistakes to which they led, woopah oh yeah yeah I shouldn't have gone away So I'm coming back today Walking back to happiness I threw away (Yay, yay, yay, yay ba dum be do) 
Walking back to happiness with you Said farewell to loneliness I knew Laid aside foolish pride Learnt the truth from tears I cried 
Spread the news I'm on my way, woopah oh yeah yeah All my blues have blown away, woopah oh yeah yeah I'm bringing you love so true 'Cause that's what I owe to you Walking back to happiness I shared with you (Yay, yay, yay, yay ba dum be do) 
Walking back to happiness with you Said farewell to loneliness I knew Laid aside foolish pride Learnt the truth from tears I cried 
Spread the news I'm on my way, woopah oh yeah yeah All my blues have blown away, woopah oh yeah yeah I'm bringing you love so true 'Cause that's what I owe to you Walking back to happiness I shared with you (Yay, yay, yay, yay ba dum be do) 
Walking back to happiness again Walking back to happiness again
