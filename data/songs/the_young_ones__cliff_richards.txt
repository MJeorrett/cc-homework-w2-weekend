The young ones, Darlin' we're the young ones. And the young ones Shouldn't be afraid  To live low  While the flame is strong 'Cause we may not be the young ones very long 
Tomorrow,  'Cause tomorrow sometimes never comes. So love me, There's a song to be sung And the best time is to sing it while we're young. 
Once in every lifetime Comes a love like this. Oh, I need you You need me. Oh my darling, can't you see? Young dreams Should be dreamed together And the young hearts shouldn't be afraid. And someday when the years have flown Darling, then we'll teach the young ones a yarn.
